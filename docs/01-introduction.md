# Introduction

FiveM clothing is built on GTA V’s ped component system.  
Each clothing item is a mesh (`.ydd`) paired with texture dictionaries (`.ytd`) and bound to a specific ped slot.

This guide focuses exclusively on **freemode peds**:
- mp_m_freemode_01
- mp_f_freemode_01

Story peds and EUP variants are intentionally excluded.
